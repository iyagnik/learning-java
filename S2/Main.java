package S2;


// Notes:

// Packages: Group classes.
// They're a bit like a folder. Why we need that => Organize, unique names, Import.
// Java comes with a lot of built in packages (called Java API sometimes)


// Class Members: 1) Part of the instance 2) Part of the class

// 1) Instance Members: Fields, Methods
// 2) Other Members: Static Members
//      The value is the same for all instances of the class.
//      The value of a static member even exists without instances.

// === Static members don't depend on instances.
// === Instance members cannot be used in static methods.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Account account1 = new Account();

    }
}
